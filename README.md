# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
ML is used in Titanic survival prediction by analyzing passenger data like age, gender etc. This involves steps like data cleaning, model training (using algorithms like Decision Trees or SVMs), and evaluating the model's performance. It helps to predict survival probabilities for passengers based on historical data from the Titanic .
